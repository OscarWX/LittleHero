# Database Setup Guide

## Quick Fix for Current Error

You're seeing the error "Failed to update book data: User must be authenticated" because your database is missing the book creation columns. Here's how to fix it:

## Required Steps (in order):

### 1. âœ… Already completed: Initial Migration

You've already run `assets/SUPABASE_INITIAL_MIGRATION.sql`

### 2. ðŸ”§ **MISSING - Run this now**: Book Creation Migration

Go to your Supabase SQL Editor and run:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of assets/SUPABASE_BOOK_CREATION_MIGRATION.sql
```

This adds the missing columns:

- `theme`
- `qualities`
- `magical_details`
- `magical_image_url`
- `special_memories`
- `special_memories_image_url`
- `narrative_style`
- `creation_data`
- `story_content`
- `generation_prompt`

### 3. Optional: Auth Setup

If you haven't already, also run `assets/SUPABASE_AUTH_SETUP.sql`

### 4. Optional: Storage Buckets

If you plan to use image uploads, run `assets/SUPABASE_BUCKET_CREATION.sql` (after creating the buckets manually in Supabase Dashboard)

## What the error means:

- Your code is trying to save theme data to a `theme` column
- But that column doesn't exist yet because the book creation migration wasn't run
- I've updated the code to handle this gracefully, but you still need to run the migration for full functionality

## After running the migration:

The theme saving should work perfectly, and you can continue with the book creation flow.
